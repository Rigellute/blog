          <p>
            Before discovering my passion for programming, I intended to become
            an academic philosopher: studying for a BA in Philosophy at
            University and then an MA. But before continuing on to a PhD, I
            decided to take a break from education.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took an internship at a classical music publishing house. Music
            was my first passion, so this seemed like a good start. It was here
            that I got involved in an internal startup building an app to read
            sheet music. This was the spark that kindled my love of programming.
          </p>
          <p>
            I then left the internship to try building my own startup. I taught
            myself to code, whilst doing freelance web development on the side.
            Six months later, the startup wasnâ€™t sustainable, so I started my
            first full-time job as a full stack developer at an investor-backed
            early-stage startup called Rota. I was the third technical hire, so
            got to have a large impact early on.
          </p>
          <p>
            From there, I founded my consulting company, Keliris Consulting,
            where I worked for seven years. And now I work for a US Fintech
            company as a Vice President of Engineering.
          </p>

            Talk to me about Rust ðŸ¦€, Zig, Golang, Typescript, React,
            Kubernetes, AWS, Docker, and much more!
