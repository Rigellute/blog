      <ToolsSection title="Programming Languages">
        <Tool title="Rust">
          Rust is my favourite programming language, thanks to its powerful type
          system and modern tooling. When it successfully compiles, you know
          that it will run with a high degree of safety and you get unparalled
          runtime performance 🚀.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="Typescript">
          I’ve spent most of my career in the Typescript/Javascript/Node.js
          ecosystem. Despite having my frustrations with Typescript, it is an
          excellent upgrade to vanilla Javascript and I’ve used it extensively.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="Go">
          Go is a great choice for backend web servers. It’s a very productive
          language, and you get a nice fast binary at the end. It can get a
          little frustrating when you think like a Rust developer (no enums!)
          but I would take a Go project over a Node.js project.

      <ToolsSection title="Workstation">
        <Tool title="15” MacBook Pro (2019)">
          This is an Intel-based MacBook Pro, and has served me well over the
          years. Ready to upgrade to the new Apple Silicon though!
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="Custom-built PC (Windows & WSL)">
          This PC is my workhorse. Although the host OS is Windows, I mostly
          stay in WSL, which is fantastic. WSL lets me keep my hard-won unix
          knowledge from my years on macOS. I should probably just install a
          linux distro directly, but Windows has its conveniences for non-dev
          tasks.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="Custom-built Keyboards">
          I regularly use two custom-built keyboards. One is an ortholinear
          split keyboard and the other is a plank-style 40% board. Both have
          small form factors, which means I’m always a one key distance away
          from whatever I need to type, but has the tradeoff of needing to
          remember many custom combinations and layers. Both keyboards are
          configured using QMK.
        </Tool>
      </ToolsSection>
      <ToolsSection title="Development tools">
        <Tool title="Neovim">
          When I just want to focus and code, nothing beats Neovim. I’ve been
          using Neovim has my primary editor for around 5 years and love it. Vim
          is well known for efficiency and speed, and my flow-state is best
          achived when coding in nvim.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="JetBrains">
          Along side Neovim, I use IntelliJ IDEA Ultimate (with vim bindings
          enabled). Despite configuring nvim to have an IDE grade feature set,
          the JetBrains IDEs are best-in-class for intellisense, refactoring and
          debugging. When I need to do big refactors, like moving files/folders
          or use the debugger, I always reach for Intellij.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="kitty">
          On my Macbook, I use Kitty. It’s is a very fast terminal emulator that
          supports ligatures, so my nvim setup is still aesthetic.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="Windows Terminal">
          On my Windows PC, I use the Windows Terminal. Pleasantly suprised how
          good this terminal emulator is. Easily customisable, very fast, and is
          my gateway to WSL.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="Zellij">
          I use Zellij for my terminal workspace. I used tmux for years, but
          Zellij comes configured how I like out-of-the-box.
        </Tool>
        <Tool title="LazyVim">
          I built up a large vim config over the years, but got fatigued
          maintaining it. Intellij was a dream to use as it hardly needs any
          configuration, so I started to get jaded with my vim config. But then
          I discovered LazyVim, which transforms Neovim into a full-fledged IDE
          with hardly any effort from me. I’ve tried other vim config systems
          before, but this hits the sweet spot as it’s super fast and easy to
          customize and extend.
