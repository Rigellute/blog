For years, I maintained a highly customised esoteric vim config that eventually became a maintenance burden. I started spending more time in traditional IDEs like Intellij (with vim mode enabled, of course), which work out-of-the-box with all the features you'd expect from an IDE.

I always missed the pure efficiency and speed of `nvim` but was willing to accept the loss due to the advanced features of Intellij: amazing refactoring capabilities, best-in-class debugger and near zero config.

But I dreamt of an Intellij level experience in `nvim`. I wanted an opinionated, easily customizable and fast `nvim` config framework to carry most of the maintenance burden for me.

I tried using [LunarVim](https://www.lunarvim.org/) and [AstroNvim](https://github.com/AstroNvim/AstroNvim), which are both amazing projects, but I kept finding snagging issues that stopped me from wanting to go all in.

I've now discovered [LazyVim](https://www.lazyvim.org/), which hits the sweet spot: super fast to launch, sane defaults and easily customisable thanks to the amazing [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim) foundation.

My config has never been so clean while packing in so much functionality. Highly recommend!
