Despite not using VSCode, I saw one of my colleagues using [this purple theme](https://github.com/ahmadawais/shades-of-purple-vscode) and I loved it.

I wanted to start using it in vim, but discovered that there was not yet an implementation for it.

I've always been interested in building my own theme (which I have since done with [Rigel](https://keliris.dev/rigel-theme)), and thought I would try implementing the Shades of Purple colorscheme myself.

And down the vim styling rabbit hole I went!

You can find the [vim implementation here](https://github.com/Rigellute/shades-of-purple.vim).
