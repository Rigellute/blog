I'm a Software Engineer based in London - I build full stack applications for the mobile and web.

Experienced with JavaScript, TypeScript, React, React Native, Node, ReasonoML, GraphQL, Postgres, SQL, AWS, Serverless stacks, and more recently Rust ðŸ’ª.

I am the author of [spotify-tui](https://github.com/Rigellute/spotify-tui) - a Spotify client for the terminal written in Rust ðŸš€.

I want to be using Rust full time! Please get in touch if you are using it!

### Other interests

When I'm not programming, I play music (piano, guitar and lute), build mechanical keyboards, read books, swing kettle bells, go rock climbing, gaze at the stars, paint with watercolours and spend time with friends and family.

### Rigellute

I can be known online as **Rigellute** - pronounced `Ryjel lute`.

I chose this name since [Rigel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rigel), a bright star in the constellation of Orion, is one of my favourite stars in the night sky. And [lute](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lute), because I play one!
